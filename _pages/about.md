As part of the Microsoft EMEA Higher Education Summit meeting in Brussels in
March 2019, members of the *Research Software Engineering (RSE)* community
across EMEA held a round table discussion with Microsoft to explore ways of
making Cloud more research friendly. While a diverse range of opportunities
and barriers were touched upon, the key issue that dominated discussion was
**skills and training** in the context of both RSE's and the communities they
support. Microsoft has created a vast repository of training material (on
GitHub) and many learning pathways through that material. However, few of
these have been created with the academic research community in mind.

The **Research Software Reactor** was established to create a focal point the RSE
community and Microsoft to come together and create learning pathways
specifically designed for the research community. The strategy is to run a
series of sprint/hackathon style events that focus on a specific theme or proof-of-concept (POC) project within research software computing with the objectives:
* Create repositories based on scenario/POC solutions for RSEs to build upon.
  - Infrastructure templates for deployment.
  - Hands on training and specialized learning resources.
  - Provide bases for developing cost model for budgeting.
* Troubleshoot issues experienced by research community using Cloud.
